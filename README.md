# MERN-Stack

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to modify the functionality of the Cabana Joe's Hospitality Products webpage. Currently, the Website has no on-line store functionality and is coming soon. Our group took on the development of an online store with complete functionality.
<br />
<br />
The client is able to purchase products from our newly designed website as well as receive confirmation of their purchase. When purchasing a new product, the client will also be prompted to enter payment information.
